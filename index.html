* **Key Data & Source Materials:** ${p.sources}
* **Report Objective:** ${p.objective}
* **Core Analogies (Optional but Recommended):** ${p.analogies || 'None specified.'}

**2. Mandatory Writing and Style Guide**

* **Tone and Clarity:** The tone must be professional, direct, and objective. The language must be clear and accessible. Avoid passive voice. Do not use meaningless filler words or phrases like "tapestry," "symphony," "delve," "labyrinth," or constructions like "it's not about X, it's about Y." Don't overuse colons, semicolons, or em dashes where not necessary.
* **Structure and Formatting:** The report must be clearly organized with a logical flow. All headings and subheadings must be in **sentence case**, not title case.
* **Factual Integrity:** Every claim or assertion must be directly supported by the provided source materials. **You must not invent or hallucinate any facts, statistics, or sources.** If information is missing, state that it is unavailable.
* **Citations:** All sources must be cited in-text and listed in a final "References" section using **APA 7th Edition format**. For online sources, the reference must end with a direct, clickable URL enclosed in < >. Example: \`Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of work*. Source. <https://...>\`
* **Use of Analogies:** Use the provided analogies sparingly and purposefully. They should only be used to (a) clarify a complex technical concept or (b) reframe an issue to make a persuasive point more effectively. Do not use them as rhetorical flourishes.
* Writing should be clear and direct, precise, and easy to follow/understand even for a non-expert with around 12th grade reading level. I want you to minimize unnecessary jargon while still using precise language including technical language where needed. Use varied sentence structure to ensure the writing has a smooth flow and rhythm. Try to avoid clunky or choppy prose style.
* I want you to avoid phrases that overstate importance or symbolism (e.g., "serves as a testament to," "plays a vital role," "it is a symbol of"). Do not use promotional, subjective, or peacock terms (e.g., "breathtaking," "must-visit," "iconic," "remarkable").
* Minimize use summarizing phrases at the end of paragraphs or sections (e.g., "In conclusion," "In summary," "Overall"). Minimize overusing transitional words and conjunctions like "moreover," "in addition," "furthermore," and "however." 
* I want you to avoid 'AI slop' writing styles and constructions. Do not use the words 'delve', 'tapestry', 'labyrinth', 'symphony'. For headings and subheadings, I prefer mostly sentence case to title case. Minimize use of colons. Do not use emojis. Minimize use of boldface or excessive formatting in general.
* Avoid superficial analyses that introduce unnecessary opinions, especially by tacking on a clause of surface-level opinion or commentary after factual information (e.g. in "The protest movement emerged as a continuation of this struggle, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and collective action in the fight for justice.", the "emphasizing the..." clause is pointless).
* I need you to strictly avoid the 'it's not x, it's y' type of phrasing or construction. This direct negation-affirmation construction can lead to generic and superficial writing with false dichotomies. I need to use negative parallelisms as a whole very sparingly. In cases where a negative parallelism would be useful to illustrate or make a rhetorical point, I need to phrase it differently (e.g. "Whereas x, we now see that y...", "At one point, x was ... We now know that y ...", "In contrast to x, y has been ...", "Although x is ..."). 
* Prefer the active voice to passive voice in most contexts, except in cases where the passive voice has a purpose like being more diplomatic or understated. Use definite, specific, and concrete language. Prefer to have coordinate ideas expressed in similar forms. Prefer placing the emphatic words or most important material at the end of a sentence for emphasis. Do not overwrite - clarity is fundamental. 
* Do not have a preamble before the answer or a note after the answer. Never address me directly or use conversational filler rather than just providing the response. Do not ever refer to yourself as an AI or mention your knowledge cutoff date.

**2. Required Output Structure**

Generate a detailed research plan with the following comprehensive sections. You must first determine the best paradigm (quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods) and then build the plan accordingly.

---

### **Comprehensive Research Plan**

### **1. Recommended Research Paradigm & Design**
* **Paradigm Justification:** First, state whether the research question is best answered using a **quantitative**, **qualitative**, or **mixed-methods** approach. Justify your choice based on the nature of the question (e.g., "Is it asking 'how much?' or 'why/how'?").
* **Overall Research Design Discussion & Recommendation:**
    * **If Quantitative:** Recommend a specific design like a **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)**, **Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)**, or **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**. Briefly explain why this design is the best fit for establishing causality in this context.
    * **If Qualitative:** Discuss 2-3 viable qualitative designs from the Rainbow Framework (e.g., **Case Study**, **Contribution Analysis**, **Most Significant Change**). For each, briefly explain its strengths and weaknesses in relation to the user's research question. After the discussion, state your final recommended design and justify the choice.

### **2. Data Collection Strategy**
*(Provide this section if the user has not specified 'Available Data' or if new data is required.)*
* **Proposed Method:** Recommend a primary data collection strategy.
* **Quantitative Data:** If quantitative data is needed, suggest methods like a **National Opinion Polling Model** (with considerations for weighting and sampling bias) or **Web Scraping** from online sources (e.g., social media, news archives) using tools like ParseHub.
* **Qualitative Data:** If qualitative data is needed, suggest methods like **Appreciative Inquiry**, **Beneficiary Assessment**, or structured interviews for **Oral Histories**.
* **Implementation Steps:** Provide a brief, actionable outline of the steps to execute the data collection.

### **3. Quantitative Analysis Plan (If Applicable)**
* **a. Causal Framework:**
    * Draw a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** as a code block or text description to map the causal relationships between the treatment, outcome, and potential confounders.
    * Identify the key causal question and the core identification challenge (e.g., "The challenge is selection bias...").
* **b. Statistical Model:**
    * **Regression Equation:** Specify the primary regression equation to be estimated (e.g., $y = B_0 + B_1X_1 + B_2X_2 + E$). Define each variable.
    * **Model Type:** Recommend a regression type (e.g., "Linear OLS," "Logit").
    * **R Code:** Provide the complete R code to run the analysis. The code **must be very heavily commented**, explaining each line or code block's purpose, function arguments, and logic so a layperson can understand the process.
* **c. How to Interpret Results:** Explain how the user would interpret the key outputs from the recommended statistical model:
    * **Coefficients:** Explain what the coefficients represent. If recommending a non-linear model (e.g., Logit), explain how to interpret its output (e.g., as log-odds or by converting to odds ratios).
    * **Variable Transformations:** If variables are transformed (e.g., using a logarithm), explain how to interpret the resulting coefficient (e.g., "A 1% increase in X is associated with a B1-unit change in Y").
    * **Key Statistics:** Explain the practical meaning of the **p-value** (the probability the result is due to chance) and the **R-squared** (the proportion of variance explained by the model).

### **4. Qualitative Analysis Plan (If Applicable)**
* **a. Analytical Framework:** Based on your recommendation in Section 1, state the chosen qualitative approach (e.g., "Thematic Analysis" for a Case Study, or the filtering process for "Most Significant Change").
* **b. Process:** Outline the steps for analysis. For example, for a **Contribution Analysis** approach, this would include:
    1.  Mapping out the intended theory of change.
    2.  Gathering existing evidence for each link in the causal chain.
    3.  Assembling and assessing the contribution claim, and seeking out alternative explanations.
* **c. Presentation of Findings:** Suggest how the qualitative findings will be presented (e.g., as a contribution narrative, a series of case studies, or a thematic report).

### **5. Potential Pitfalls and Limitations**
* **a. Threats to Validity:** Discuss potential threats to the validity of your recommended design (e.g., for DiD, the "parallel trends" assumption; for RCTs, potential for sample contamination or ethical concerns).
* **b. Data-Specific Issues:** If using scraped web data, mention potential issues like selection bias (e.g., only capturing complaints when prices are high) and the need to cross-validate with other sources.
* **c. Logical and Contextual Considerations:** Provide a checklist of contextual questions the researcher must consider.`,

* **Convention for this report:** ${p.convention}
* **Source materials to analyze:** ${p.sources}

---

### Part 2: Core instructions for synthesis

* **Factual integrity:** Your primary task is to read, analyze, and synthesize information **exclusively** from the provided source materials. Do not invent facts, policies, or data.
* **Strict citation required:** For every piece of information, every statistic, and every policy you mention, you **must** indicate which source document it came from. Use a clear citation format, like \`[Source: file_name.pdf]\`. This is critical for verification.
* **Voice and tone:** The tone must be formal, objective, and bureaucratic, suitable for a UN submission. Avoid emotive or subjective language.
* Writing should be clear and direct, precise, and easy to follow/understand even for a non-expert with around 12th grade reading level. I want you to minimize unnecessary jargon while still using precise language including technical language where needed. Use varied sentence structure to ensure the writing has a smooth flow and rhythm. Try to avoid clunky or choppy prose style.
* I want you to avoid phrases that overstate importance or symbolism (e.g., "serves as a testament to," "plays a vital role," "it is a symbol of"). Do not use promotional, subjective, or peacock terms (e.g., "breathtaking," "must-visit," "iconic," "remarkable").
* Minimize use summarizing phrases at the end of paragraphs or sections (e.g., "In conclusion," "In summary," "Overall"). Minimize overusing transitional words and conjunctions like "moreover," "in addition," "furthermore," and "however." 
* I want you to avoid 'AI slop' writing styles and constructions. Do not use the words 'delve', 'tapestry', 'labyrinth', 'symphony'. For headings and subheadings, I prefer mostly sentence case to title case. Minimize use of colons. Do not use emojis. Minimize use of boldface or excessive formatting in general.
* Avoid superficial analyses that introduce unnecessary opinions, especially by tacking on a clause of surface-level opinion or commentary after factual information (e.g. in "The protest movement emerged as a continuation of this struggle, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and collective action in the fight for justice.", the "emphasizing the..." clause is pointless).
* I need you to strictly avoid the 'it's not x, it's y' type of phrasing or construction. This direct negation-affirmation construction can lead to generic and superficial writing with false dichotomies. I need to use negative parallelisms as a whole very sparingly. In cases where a negative parallelism would be useful to illustrate or make a rhetorical point, I need to phrase it differently (e.g. "Whereas x, we now see that y...", "At one point, x was ... We now know that y ...", "In contrast to x, y has been ...", "Although x is ..."). 
* Prefer the active voice to passive voice in most contexts, except in cases where the passive voice has a purpose like being more diplomatic or understated. Use definite, specific, and concrete language. Prefer to have coordinate ideas expressed in similar forms. Prefer placing the emphatic words or most important material at the end of a sentence for emphasis. Do not overwrite - clarity is fundamental. 
* Do not have a preamble before the answer or a note after the answer. Never address me directly or use conversational filler rather than just providing the response. Do not ever refer to yourself as an AI or mention your knowledge cutoff date.
* Be diplomatic. Moral clarity is fine, but we have to work with various other departments and agencies, so things like being particularly harsh about any person or institution’s competence or intentions, making assumptions that are unfounded, etc… could be disastrous given the bureaucratic and political nature of the work.
* This doesn’t mean being evasive on the facts or avoiding necessary criticism, but it does mean avoiding assumptions or accusations and avoiding overly harsh or confrontational language – phrasing significant criticism or negative assessments in neutral language and diplomatic framing. For example, if a failure seems likely to be attributable to malice or corruption but there is no explicit proof, the diplomatic way might be to call it misaligned incentives or conflicts of interest, or to frame it as being a public perception (e.g. “.. raising questions of corruption within the public” rather than directly accusing it of corruption). Or for failures from incompetence, the diplomatic way might be to talk about human capacity gaps or need for institutional strengthening, and so on.
* Being diplomatic also means being sensitive to political, geopolitical, and religious contexts. This means avoiding party politics as much as possible, and keeping in mind that the Maldives is an institutionally Muslim country.

- Every document cited (official reports, news articles, laws, academic articles, NGO briefs, etc.) must be included with a brief annotation.
- For citations from the Excel sheet, include the actual sheet and row number if possible, or at least the full headline you used
- APA style citations, with direct links wherever available.
- Footnotes so everything is mentioned

Language and Style Requirements:
- Use clear, direct language with no filler or embellishment.
- Avoid unnecessary modifiers; each sentence must deliver substantive content.
- Maintain professional tone suitable for international expert and government readership.
- Include English translations of Dhivehi materials wherever applicable, with translator notes or methodology if needed.
- Everything in this paper has to be justified by some kind of evidence or information from a source, do not speculate or make anything up.
- Writing should be clear and direct, precise, and easy to follow/understand even for a non-expert with around 12th grade reading level. I want you to minimize unnecessary jargon while still using precise language including technical language where needed.
- Use varied sentence structure to ensure the writing has a smooth flow and rhythm. Try to avoid clunky or choppy prose style.
- I want you to avoid phrases that overstate importance or symbolism (e.g., "serves as a testament to," "plays a vital role," "it is a symbol of"). Do not use promotional, subjective, or peacock terms (e.g., "breathtaking," "must-visit," "iconic," "remarkable").
- Minimize use summarizing phrases at the end of paragraphs or sections (e.g., "In conclusion," "In summary," "Overall"). Minimize overusing transitional words and conjunctions like "moreover," "in addition," "furthermore," and "however." 
- I want you to avoid 'AI slop' writing styles and constructions. Do not use the words 'delve', 'tapestry', 'labyrinth', 'symphony'. For headings and subheadings, I prefer mostly sentence case to title case. Minimize use of colons. Do not use emojis. Minimize use of boldface or excessive formatting in general.
- Avoid superficial analyses that introduce unnecessary opinions, especially by tacking on a clause of surface-level opinion or commentary after factual information (e.g. in "The protest movement emerged as a continuation of this struggle, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and collective action in the fight for justice.", the "emphasizing the..." clause is pointless).
- I need you to strictly avoid the 'it's not x, it's y' type of phrasing or construction. This direct negation-affirmation construction can lead to generic and superficial writing with false dichotomies. I need to use negative parallelisms as a whole very sparingly. In cases where a negative parallelism would be useful to illustrate or make a rhetorical point, I need to phrase it differently (e.g. "Whereas x, we now see that y...", "At one point, x was ... We now know that y ...", "In contrast to x, y has been ...", "Although x is ..."). 
- Prefer the active voice to passive voice in most contexts, except in cases where the passive voice has a purpose like being more diplomatic or understated. Use definite, specific, and concrete language. Prefer to have coordinate ideas expressed in similar forms. Prefer placing the emphatic words or most important material at the end of a sentence for emphasis. Do not overwrite - clarity is fundamental. 
- Do not have a preamble before the answer or a note after the answer. Never address me directly or use conversational filler rather than just providing the response. Do not ever refer to yourself as an AI or mention your knowledge cutoff date.

**3. Required Output Structure**

---

### **Policy Resilience and Sustainability Plan: [User's Policy Name]**

### **1. Structural "Stickiness": Making the policy hard to reverse**

* **Binding Mechanisms:** Based on the policy goal, what specific, irreversible components can be built in? Recommend concrete actions.
    * *Example: Suggest specific long-term contracts, public-private partnership agreements, or legal obligations that would be difficult or costly for a future administration to unwind.*
* **Building a Beneficiary Coalition:** How can the policy create a constituency that will actively defend it?
    * *Example: Identify the groups that benefit most and suggest ways to organize and empower them to advocate for the policy's continuation.*

### **2. Self-Reinforcing Momentum: Creating positive feedback loops**

* **Early, Visible Wins:** What specific, high-visibility milestones can be achieved quickly to build momentum and demonstrate value?
    * *Example: Suggest a pilot program in a key political district or a public launch event celebrating an initial, tangible outcome.*
* **Incentive Alignment:** How can the policy be designed so that its success creates further incentives for adoption and expansion?
    * *Example: Recommend a funding model where successful implementation in one department unlocks additional resources or autonomy, creating a positive feedback loop.*

### **3. Operational Resilience: Planning for human and institutional factors**

* **Staff Turnover and Knowledge Management:** What is the plan to mitigate the risk of key staff leaving?
    * *Example: Recommend the creation of detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), process video recordings, and a centralized knowledge base to ensure institutional memory survives transitions.*
* **Minimizing Single Points of Failure:** How will the policy avoid over-reliance on specific individuals?
    * *Example: Suggest a team-based structure with built-in redundancy for critical tasks, ensuring no single person holds all essential knowledge or connections.*
* **Protecting Against Deprioritization:** What mechanisms will keep the policy on the agenda when new leadership or crises emerge?
    * *Example: Propose mandatory public reporting requirements or linking the policy's outcomes to the performance metrics of senior officials to ensure it remains a priority.*

### **4. External Durability: Embedding the policy in a wider network**

* **Leveraging Non-State Actors:** How can NGOs, private sector actors, or international organizations be engaged to enhance sustainability?
    * *Example: Suggest specific partnerships where a non-state actor takes on a key implementation role, making the program more robust against shifting government priorities or budget cuts.*
* **Securing Long-Term Commitments:** What is the strategy for securing multi-year funding and long-term partnership agreements?
    * *Example: Recommend tying the policy to long-term national development plans or international agreements that span multiple political cycles.*`,

**2. Mandatory Framework**

You must analyze the policy through the lenses of second-order effects, perverse incentives, collective action problems, corruption risks, and implementation bottlenecks. Your output must be a comprehensive risk register that identifies all plausible risks, not just a few examples.

**3. Required Output Structure**

---

### **Risk and Bottleneck Analysis Report**

### **1. Second- and Third-Order Effects**

* **Description:** Analyze the potential cascading consequences beyond the immediate policy goal. Think through how the policy might ripple through related systems, markets, or social behaviors.
* **Potential Effects:**
    * *Based on the policy goal, list all plausible unintended consequences. For example, if the policy subsidizes a specific technology, consider the impact on competing industries, the long-term maintenance burden, and the potential for market distortion.*
* **Mitigation Strategy:**
    * *For each potential effect, suggest a specific design tweak, monitoring plan, or counter-measure to mitigate it.*

### **2. Perverse Incentives and Dysfunctional Metrics**

* **Description:** Identify all the ways the policy might accidentally incentivize behavior that undermines its core purpose, with reference to established principles.
* **Potential Perverse Incentives (Analysis of the "Cobra Effect," Campbell's/Goodhart's Law):**
    * *Example: If the policy rewards staff based on the number of applications processed, analyze how this could lead to rushed, low-quality work instead of meaningful outcomes. Suggest alternative metrics focused on quality or impact.*
* **Mitigation Strategy:**
    * *Propose performance indicators that are harder to manipulate and more closely aligned with the actual policy goal.*

### **3. Collective Action Problems**

* **Description:** Analyze if the policy is vulnerable to problems where individual self-interest undermines the collective good (e.g., tragedy of the commons, free-riding).
* **Potential Problems:**
    * *Example: If the policy creates a public resource, assess whether it could be depleted because individual users have no incentive to conserve it.*
* **Mitigation Strategy:**
    * *Suggest specific design features to prevent this, such as access restrictions, user fees to internalize costs, or mechanisms that enhance coordination and trust.*

### **4. Corruption and Sabotage**

* **Description:** Identify all potential avenues for corruption that the policy might inadvertently create or fail to close, and consider the potential for internal resistance.
* **Potential Avenues for Corruption:**
    * *Analyze the status quo to identify who benefits from existing inefficiencies. Pinpoint how they might react to the policy change and suggest how to prepare for this pushback.*
* **Potential for Bureaucratic Sabotage:**
    * *Consider how internal actors might quietly resist the change. Propose strategies to counter this, such as simplifying processes to reduce discretionary power and building in strong accountability measures.*

### **5. Implementation Bottlenecks and Capacity Gaps**

* **Description:** Pinpoint the most likely operational obstacles that could stall implementation.
* **Likely Bottlenecks:**
    * *Based on common government processes, identify all potential delays (e.g., procurement, legal review, inter-departmental approvals) and suggest targeted strategies to address them.*
* **Institutional Capacity Gaps:**
    * *Honestly assess whether the implementing agencies have the necessary skills, resources, and authority. If not, recommend specific capacity-building initiatives or partnerships to fill those gaps before launch.*`,

* **3.1. Monitoring & Communication Cadence:**
    * **"Scoreboard" of Critical Indicators:** Identify 3-4 key metrics to track progress (e.g., % of tasks on time, budget vs. actuals).
    * **Meeting Schedule:** Recommend a rhythm for check-ins (e.g., "Daily 15-minute stand-ups" or "Weekly sprint reviews").
    * **Overcommunication Plan:** For critical handoffs, specify that communication should happen across multiple channels (e.g., email, chat, in-person).
* **3.2. Change Management Process:**
    * Recommend a "change budget" or a clear re-prioritization process to manage scope creep. Any new request requires removing an existing task of equivalent effort.

**2. Required Output Structure**

Generate the plan using the following multi-part structure. Your analysis must be thorough, identifying potential issues within the data file and providing concrete solutions and strategic enhancements.

---

### **Data Cleaning & Exploratory Analysis Plan**

### **Part 1: Initial Data Assessment**

1.  **File Overview:** State the file name and its likely format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
2.  **Column Identification:** List all column headers found in the dataset.
3.  **Data Type Inference:** For each column, infer the data type (e.g., Numeric, Text, Date, Categorical).
4.  **Suitability Analysis:** Briefly assess if the available columns and data types seem suitable for addressing the stated **Research Topic/Goal**. Highlight any obvious gaps (e.g., "The dataset lacks a date column, which will make trend analysis difficult.").

### **Part 2: Step-by-Step Data Cleaning Plan**

For each potential data integrity issue you identify, present it in a structured format. Address common issues like inconsistent formats, spelling errors, duplicates, and missing values.

**Issue 1: [Name of the Identified Issue (e.g., Inconsistent Spelling in 'department' column)]**
* **How to Identify:** (e.g., "The 'department' column may contain variations like 'HR', 'H.R.', and 'Human Resources'.")
* **Excel Solution:**
    1.  **Identify Variations:** Use the formula \`=UNIQUE(A2:A100)\` (adjust range) in a new sheet to see all unique entries.
    2.  **Standardize:** Use nested \`SUBSTITUTE()\` functions or the 'Find and Replace' tool to standardize the variations to a single format (e.g., 'Human Resources').
* **R Solution:**
    \`\`\`R
    # Load necessary library
    library(dplyr)

    # See all unique values to identify inconsistencies
    unique(your_dataframe$department)

    # Standardize values using case_when()
    your_dataframe <- your_dataframe %>%
      mutate(department = case_when(
        department %in% c("HR", "H.R.") ~ "Human Resources",
        # Add other conditions here
        TRUE ~ department # Keep other values as they are
      ))
    \`\`\`

**(Repeat this structure for every issue you identify.)**

### **Part 3: Unstructured Text Analysis & Structuring Plan**

*(Analyze any columns containing long-form text, like 'notes' or 'description'.)*

**Analysis of Column '[Column Name]':**
* **Observation:** (e.g., "The 'casework_notes' field is unstructured text, but frequently contains recurring information about household composition, disability status, and housing conditions.")
* **Recommendation:** Decompose this text field into multiple structured columns to make the data analyzable. The original text field can be kept for unique, case-specific context.
* **Proposed New Columns:**
    * \`num_children\`: Numeric
    * \`has_disability\`: Binary (1/0)
    * \`housing_condition\`: Categorical (e.g., "Overcrowded", "Adequate", "Substandard")
    * \`receives_assistance\`: Binary (1/0)
* **Implementation Strategy (R Example):**
    \`\`\`R
    library(stringr)
    # Extract number of children using regular expressions
    your_dataframe <- your_dataframe %>%
      mutate(
        num_children = as.numeric(str_extract(casework_notes, "\\\\d+(?= child)")),
        has_disability = ifelse(str_detect(casework_notes, "disability|disabled"), 1, 0)
      )
    \`\`\`

### **Part 4: Data Dictionary and Structural Recommendations**

Based on your analysis, provide a data dictionary that documents the current state of variables and recommends structural changes or new variable creation for improved analysis.

| Variable Name | Current State (Type/Format) | Recommended State / New Variable | Rationale for Change / Creation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Existing Vars** | | | |
| [e.g., employee_id] | [e.g., Numeric] | Keep as is | Serves as a unique identifier. |
| [e.g., housing_type] | Numeric (Ordinal: 4,5,6,7,8) | Decompose into multiple new variables. | Ordinal numbers imply a ranked relationship that doesn't exist. Binary variables are better for regression analysis. |
| **Newly Created** | | | |
| [e.g., own_home] | Newly Created | Binary (1 or 0) | Creates a clear binary variable for homeownership from \`housing_type\` codes 4 and 5. |
| [e.g., renter] | Newly Created | Binary (1 or 0) | Isolates renters (from \`housing_type\` code 6) for targeted analysis. |
| [e.g., homeless] | Newly Created | Binary (1 or 0) | Isolates individuals experiencing homelessness (from \`housing_type\` code 8). |

### **Part 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Plan**

This section should provide code and instructions for the user to explore their newly cleaned and structured data.

1.  **Summary Statistics:**
    * **Explanation:** Explain that summary statistics help identify strange values and understand data distribution.
    * **R Code & Interpretation:**
        \`\`\`R
        # Get summary statistics for the entire dataset
        summary(your_dataframe)
        # How to interpret: Look at the Min/Max values for numeric columns. Are they plausible?
        \`\`\`
2.  **Visual Outlier Detection:**
    * **Explanation:** Explain that plotting each variable is the fastest way to spot outliers or errors.
    * **R Code & Interpretation (using ggplot2):**
        \`\`\`R
        library(ggplot2)
        # For a numeric variable (e.g., 'salary')
        ggplot(your_dataframe, aes(x = salary)) + geom_histogram(bins = 30)
        # How to interpret: Look for bars far away from the main group.
        \`\`\`

### **Part 6: Recommendations for Data Enhancement**

1.  **Unique Identifier:**
    * **Assessment:** (e.g., "The dataset appears to lack a unique identifier for each row, which could lead to issues tracking records or identifying duplicate entries.")
    * **Recommendation:** Create a unique ID for each row.
    * **R Code:** \`your_dataframe <- your_dataframe %>% mutate(record_id = row_number())\`
2.  **Merging with External Data for Deeper Analysis:**
    * **Strategic Suggestion:** (e.g., "The stated goal is to analyze student test scores. The current dataset contains school names but no demographic context. To conduct a more powerful analysis, you could merge this data with external sources.")
    * **Example Plan:**
        1.  **Obtain School Location Data:** Find a public dataset that lists schools with their addresses or geographic coordinates. Merge this with your data using the school name to get each student's location.
        2.  **Obtain Socioeconomic Data:** Find a public dataset with census or economic data by region (e.g., income levels by county/district).
        3.  **Merge and Analyze:** Merge the socioeconomic data based on the school's location. This allows you to analyze test scores while controlling for the wealth level of the area. This can help identify high-performing schools in low-income areas, whose practices could be replicated.

**2. Mandatory plan structure**

Generate a comprehensive plan that walks the user through creating three separate, linked Excel sheets. The plan must begin with the following overview.

---

### **Part 0: High-level overview and strategy**

**a. The goal: Creating analysis-ready data**
* Explain that the primary goal is to structure data in a way that is clean, reliable, and immediately usable for analysis (like creating reports, charts, or statistics). The challenge is that data which is easy for humans to read at a glance is often difficult for computers to analyze systematically.

**b. Three-sheet system**
* Introduce the solution: a system with three interconnected sheets designed for (1) safe and easy data entry, (2) clean and structured data storage, and (3) flexible, automated reporting.

**c. Core concept: Flattening multi-dimensional data**
* Explain data dimensions using rows and columns as the first two dimensions.
* Provide examples of a third dimension, which could be time (e.g., the same table of hospital data repeated each week) or another category (e.g., the same hospital data table repeated for different countries, students and test scores across multiple schools).
* Explain that for most analysis in Excel, this multi-dimensional data must be "flattened" or "folded down" into two dimensions (rows and columns). This is achieved by turning the third dimension (like "Week 1", "Week 2" or "Country A", "Country B" or "School A", "School B") into a new column. This process transforms the data into a "long" or "tidy" format, where every row is a single, unique observation.

**d. Core concept: "Wide" vs. "Tidy" data format**
* Visually explain the difference:
    * **Wide Data:** Easy for humans to read for one instance (like a single day's report), but difficult to analyze across instances. Often has multiple values in a single row that are the same type of measurement (e.g., columns for "Jan", "Feb", "Mar").
    * **Tidy Data:** Optimized for analysis. Every row is one observation, every column is one variable. It might seem less intuitive at first but is far more powerful. Explain that a "tidy" dataset can still be very wide if it has hundreds of variables; the key is its structure, not its literal shape.

**e. Why we need data validation and protection**
* **Data Validation:** Explain that this is about ensuring data quality at the point of entry. It's a set of rules to prevent common errors, such as:
    * *Inconsistency:* Using dropdown lists for categories like "Hospital Name" ensures it's always entered the same way, not as "IGMH" one day and "Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital" the next.
    * *Logical Impossibility:* Using custom rules to enforce logic, like ensuring "Occupied Beds" is not greater than "Total Beds".
* **Sheet Protection:** Explain that this is a critical safeguard against human error.
    * It prevents users from accidentally deleting or overwriting cells containing important formulas or labels, which could break the entire system.
    * Crucially, if a password is used, it forces any change to be **intentional**. A person casually Browse the sheet cannot make accidental edits; they must consciously decide to unprotect the sheet by entering the password, which dramatically reduces mistakes.

---

### **Part 1: The "Data Entry" sheet (The user-friendly form)**

This is the sheet the staff will interact with daily.

* **a. Recommended layout:** Describe a clean, intuitive visual layout for the form.
* **b. Step-by-step setup instructions:**
    1.  Provide a table showing which cells should contain which labels (e.g., A4: "Hospital Name", A5: "Date").
    2.  Provide a second table detailing the setup for all **data validation and dropdown lists**. It must explain *how* to do it in Excel (Go to Data > Data Validation...).
        | Cell(s) | Validation type | Instructions & formula/source | Error message (if applicable) |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    3.  Explain how to **lock all non-entry cells** (labels, headers) and **protect the sheet**, detailing the different protection options (e.g., a "Stop" error versus a "Warning").

---

### **Part 2: The "Dataset" sheet (The clean, analysis-ready data)**

This sheet will automatically collect the data from the "Data Entry" sheet into a proper, long-format table.

* **a. Explanation of purpose:** Briefly explain why this sheet is critical for time-series analysis (i.e., converting a 3D problem into a 2D table).
* **b. Recommended layout:** Design the structure of the master data table. The first column should list all the variable codes (e.g., \`igmh_gen_opd_fluclinic\`). The next column is for the values from the current day's entry form.
* **c. Step-by-step setup instructions:**
    1.  Explain how to create the list of variable codes, detailing the "Find and Replace" trick in Word to generate hundreds of variable names quickly.
    2.  Provide detailed instructions for linking the "Value" column to the "Data Entry" sheet. Include an example: "Click on cell B3 in this sheet, type \`=\`, then navigate to the 'Data Entry' sheet and click on cell C8. The formula bar will show \`='Data Entry'!C8\`. Press Enter. Now, whatever value is in C8 on the entry form will appear in B3 of your dataset.".

---

### **Part 3: The "Automated Report" sheet (The final output)**

This sheet will automatically aggregate and display data from a master dataset file.

* **a. Explanation of process:** Explain the workflow: the user will copy the "Value" column from each daily file and use **"Paste Special (Values)"** to add it as a new column in a separate master dataset file. This report will automatically update from that master file.
* **b. Recommended layout:** Design a professional, printable report layout based on the user's reporting needs.
* **c. Step-by-step setup instructions:**
    1.  Provide a table with example formulas (\`SUMIFS\`, \`AVERAGEIFS\`, \`VLOOKUP\`) to pull the required data from the master dataset into the report. Explain each argument of the function. For example: "To get the weekly total for IGMH Flu Clinic, use \`=SUM(Data!B11:H11)\`, where B11:H11 is the row containing the daily flu clinic data for the 7 days of the week in your data aggregation sheet."
    2.  If charts were requested, provide clear instructions on how to create them and link their data ranges to the auto-populating cells in the report.`,

* **Primary Objective:** ${p.objective}
* **Source Data Files:** ${p.sources}
* **Intended Final Outcome:** ${p.final_outcome}
* **Key Methodological Considerations:** ${p.methodology_notes}

**2. Mandatory Methodological Framework**

Your response **must** be framed as a developmental analysis. Embed the following principles into your step-by-step instructions:

* **Determine the Correct Analysis:** Based on the user's **Intended Final Outcome**, your first task is to determine the most appropriate GIS analysis or sequence of analyses (e.g., Suitability Modeling, Cluster Analysis, Network Analysis). You must **briefly explain this choice** at the beginning of your response before starting the step-by-step instructions.
* **Data Integrity First:** The first phase of your instructions must always involve checking the data. This includes verifying the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is appropriate for distance/area measurements (i.e., it's a projected CRS, not geographic) and checking for data errors.
* **Prioritize Clusters over Isolation:** When the objective involves identifying target populations or areas, you must explicitly recommend and provide instructions for a **cluster analysis** (e.g., using the DBSCAN algorithm in QGIS). Explain *why* this is important for development work—that serving a cluster of 4,000 people across three small islands is often better than serving one island of 2,000.
* **Incorporate Real-World Constraints:** The analysis should model reality as closely as possible. Instead of simple circular buffers, recommend using tools like the **Service Area (from network)** tool if a road/ferry network is available. If not, explain how to use cost-based buffers or other more realistic methods.
* **Actionable Visualization:** The final output should not just be data, but a clear, professional map. The final steps of your guide must include instructions on how to style the layers (e.g., using color gradients for population density, clear labels, and creating a print layout with a legend and scale bar).

**3. Required Output Structure**

Generate the response as a clear, sequential guide. Use markdown for formatting.

* Start with a brief "Recommended Approach" section explaining the analysis you've chosen.
* Use numbered headings for major phases (e.g., "### 1. Project Setup and Data Validation").
* Use numbered lists for step-by-step actions within each phase.
* Bold the names of **QGIS tools**, **panels**, and **layer names** so they are easy for the user to find.
* Provide example values or settings where appropriate.
* Conclude with a brief paragraph explaining how to interpret the final map to answer the user's primary objective.

* **Key System Components:** ${p.system_components}
* **Key Processes / Rules:** ${p.key_processes}
* **Desired Final Outcome / Metrics:** ${p.final_outcome}

**2. Mandatory Methodological Framework**

Your response must be a complete guide that teaches both the "how" and the "why." Embed the following principles into your instructions:

* **1. Choose the Right Modeling Paradigm:** Your first and most important task is to analyze the user's problem and recommend the best primary modeling paradigm. You must choose from **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)**, **System Dynamics (SD)**, or **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)**.
    * You **must** start your response with a section explaining your choice in simple, non-technical terms. For example: "For this problem, we should use Agent-Based Modeling because we need to track individual passengers with unique behaviors. If we only cared about the total number of passengers over time, we might use System Dynamics."
* **2. Define the Model Structure:** Based on your chosen paradigm, you must then clearly outline the main structural elements the user will build.
    * **If Agent-Based:** Define the agent types (e.g., \`Passenger\`, \`Ferry\`), their key parameters/variables (e.g., \`p_waitTime\`), and a simple statechart for their behavior (e.g., "Waiting -> Traveling -> Arrived").
    * **If Discrete-Event:** Map out the high-level process flowchart using blocks from AnyLogic's Process Modeling Library (e.g., \`Source\` -> \`Queue\` -> \`Delay\` -> \`Sink\`).
    * **If System Dynamics:** Identify the key stocks (e.g., \`IslandPopulation\`), flows (e.g., \`arrivals\`), and feedback loops that drive the system's behavior.
* **3. Build from Simple to Complex:** Structure your tutorial to start with the simplest possible version of the model. For example, guide the user to first build a model with just one ferry on a single route. Then, create a "Next Steps" section at the end that explains how to add more complexity, such as adding schedules, multiple ferry types, or passenger decision-making.
* **4. Connect to the Policy Question:** Explicitly connect the model's components to the user's policy objective. Identify which model parameters can be used as **"policy levers"** (e.g., \`ferryCapacity\`, \`ticketPrice\`) and which outputs will measure the results (e.g., a time plot of \`averageWaitTime\`).

**3. Required Output Structure**

Generate the response as a clear, sequential tutorial for a beginner.

* Start with a section named "**Recommended Modeling Approach**" that explains your choice of paradigm.
* Use numbered headings for major phases (e.g., "### 1. Project Setup", "### 2. Creating the Ferry Agent").
* Use numbered lists for step-by-step actions within each phase.
* **Bold** the names of **AnyLogic palette items**, **properties**, and **Java code snippets**.
* Provide clear, commented Java code snippets where necessary (e.g., for statechart actions or function calls).
* Conclude with sections on "**How to Interpret the Results**" and "**Next Steps for Adding Complexity**".

                style_instruction: p => `Writing style guide:
- Writing should be clear and direct, precise, and easy to follow/understand even for a non-expert with around 12th grade reading level. I want you to minimize unnecessary jargon while still using precise language including technical language where needed.
- Use varied sentence structure to ensure the writing has a smooth flow and rhythm. Try to avoid clunky or choppy prose style.
- I want you to avoid phrases that overstate importance or symbolism (e.g., "serves as a testament to," "plays a vital role," "it is a symbol of"). Do not use promotional, subjective, or peacock terms (e.g., "breathtaking," "must-visit," "iconic," "remarkable").
- Minimize use summarizing phrases at the end of paragraphs or sections (e.g., "In conclusion," "In summary," "Overall"). Minimize overusing transitional words and conjunctions like "moreover," "in addition," "furthermore," and "however." 
- I want you to avoid 'AI slop' writing styles and constructions. Do not use the words 'delve', 'tapestry', 'labyrinth', 'symphony'. For headings and subheadings, I prefer mostly sentence case to title case.
- Minimize use of colons. Do not use emojis. Minimize use of boldface or excessive formatting in general.
- Avoid superficial analyses that introduce unnecessary opinions, especially by tacking on a clause of surface-level opinion or commentary after factual information (e.g. in "The protest movement emerged as a continuation of this struggle, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and collective action in the fight for justice.", the "emphasizing the..." clause is pointless).
- I need you to strictly avoid the 'it's not x, it's y' type of phrasing or construction. This direct negation-affirmation construction can lead to generic and superficial writing with false dichotomies. I need to use negative parallelisms as a whole very sparingly. In cases where a negative parallelism would be useful to illustrate or make a rhetorical point, I need to phrase it differently (e.g. "Whereas x, we now see that y...", "At one point, x was ... We now know that y ...", "In contrast to x, y has been ...", "Although x is ..."). 
- Prefer the active voice to passive voice in most contexts, except in cases where the passive voice has a purpose like being more diplomatic or understated. Use definite, specific, and concrete language. Prefer to have coordinate ideas expressed in similar forms. Prefer placing the emphatic words or most important material at the end of a sentence for emphasis. Do not overwrite - clarity is fundamental. 
- Do not have a preamble before the answer or a note after the answer. Never address me directly or use conversational filler rather than just providing the response. Do not ever refer to yourself as an AI or mention your knowledge cutoff date.

---

(OPTIONAL) Being diplomatic:
- Be diplomatic. Moral clarity is fine, but we have to work with various other departments and agencies, so things like being particularly harsh about any person or institution’s competence or intentions, making assumptions that are unfounded, etc… could be disastrous given the bureaucratic and political nature of the work.
- This doesn’t mean being evasive on the facts or avoiding necessary criticism, but it does mean avoiding assumptions or accusations and avoiding overly harsh or confrontational language – phrasing significant criticism or negative assessments in neutral language and diplomatic framing. For example, if a failure seems likely to be attributable to malice or corruption but there is no explicit proof, the diplomatic way might be to call it misaligned incentives or conflicts of interest, or to frame it as being a public perception (e.g. “.. raising questions of corruption within the public” rather than directly accusing it of corruption). Or for failures from incompetence, the diplomatic way might be to talk about human capacity gaps or need for institutional strengthening, and so on.
- Being diplomatic also means being sensitive to political, geopolitical, and religious contexts. This means avoiding party politics as much as possible, and keeping in mind that the Maldives is an institutionally Muslim country.`,
